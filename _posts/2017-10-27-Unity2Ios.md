Today, I've been facing this problem (Unity Ver. 5.5 Windows Based system).

When I try to open my windows exported iOS project, i got "(..)the project file cannot be parsed". So, I decided to explore the project file, located in:

{Project path}/Unity-iPhone.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj

It is a plain text file, so you can use any text editor.

I found a line with a mismatched quotes. It was:

shellScript = "\"$PROJECT_DIR/MapFileParser.sh\""\nrm -rf \"$TARGET_BUILD_DIR/$PRODUCT_NAME.app/Data/Raw/QCAR\"";

To fix the problem, simply remove the quotation mark located at:

(...)MapFileParser.sh\" " \n(...)

It should be:

(...)MapFileparser.sh\" \n(...)

and it will be parsed correctly in xCode.

It's an automated typo error!

Good luck!
